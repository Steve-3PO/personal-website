            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>My first love besides Physics and Tech was always music, had I not been a Physicist I would have probably studied Music!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have always done some form of exercise, I am 6'3 so basketball has always been something I enjoy! I have spent years doing Rugby and in Canada I dabbled in Competitive Powerlifting</p>
